Installing Maven on Linux:

usually : sudo yum install -y apache-maven (should work).

Below are the commands that were used to install mvn on my linux box. A lil scenic route since there is no epel repo available.


sudo wget https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/dchen/apache-maven/epel-apache-maven.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo

sudo sed -i s/\$releasever/6/g /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo

sudo yum install apache-maven -y

sudo yum install -y apache-maven


To setup environment variables:(lines can be added to your .bashrc file)

export M2_HOME=/usr/share/apache-maven/apache-maven-3.5.2

export M2=$M2_HOME/bin

export PATH=$M2:$PATH

mvn --version
